## Getting started with Java in FTC

In our "Mastering Control in FTC" post, we talked about the potential for creating software that enhances robot ability. 

But in order to do this, you need to have a solid foundation with creating software. Programming is what creates software,

and the programming language used in FTC is called [Java](https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/software/fundamental-concepts.html).

#### Cirriculum
 
On UltraFTC, you can find lessons about Java. The cirriculum is as follows
1. https://alessiotoniolo.github.io/2022/01/31/control-in-ftc.html
  a. An introduction into the potential of FTC programming. Topics are revisted near the end of the cirriculum
  b. Provides a motivation for learning Java
2. https://alessiotoniolo.github.io/2022/01/31/getting-started-with-java.html
  a. Why you should learn Java, and how to get started with the cirriculum

### Setting up CodeHS

In order to start learning Java, join the CodeHS class, a website where you can find guided lessons and activities for learning Java.

1. Click on this link: [https://codehs.com/join_class/78A30](https://codehs.com/join_class/78A30)
2. Press "Sign in with Google"
3. Once you have signed into Google, you will be redirected back to a CodeHS page
4. Scroll down until you see a big, green button that says "Finish Account", and press it!
5. In the middle of the page, under "My Progess", there should be a bar that says "Cristo Rey Robotics 2022." Click on it!

*Tutorial on CodeHS installation. Recommended start at 2:16!*

I recommend that you scroll down and start at **Basic Java**. To become a confident programmer, I highly, highly, recommend you complete each section, each lesson, 
and complete the basic java unit. If you would like to continue learning more about Java, ask us about recommended lessons!

### Why learn Java

Not only is Java used to program FTC robotics, it is commonly used to teach programming in schools, and it is also used to program software for companies!
By learning Java, you can create great FTC robots, do well in classes like AP Computer Science, and be prepared for STEM jobs! Also, **it is a ton of fun!!!**.
