## Taking the Next Step in CAD

A typical FTC team may come up with an idea and proceed to immediately build it with the idea in their heads. 

However, as designs become more and more complex, it is harder to imagine, test, and implement the design.

That is why teams used CAD to design robot parts, drivetrain, mechanisms and more. They allow teams to

obtain the exact parts they need, look at measurements, and even create custom, 3D printed parts!

### What is CAD?
 
CAD stands for computer-aided design and is a way to digitally create 2D drawings and 3D models of real-world designs before they're ever manufactured.
In FTC, it can also be used to assemble alerady made 3D models. Suppliers like Tetrix and GoBilda provide CAD models that you can import for all parts.

### Setting up OnShape

The Bots in Black recommend you use OnShape, an online CAD collaboration website. Written instructions on how to setup OnShape can be found [here](http://nebomusic.net/ftc/Directions_Create_OnShape_Account.pdf).

Here is a video that goes over the same set of steps for setting up OnShape: 
[Mr. Michaud's OnShape Setup Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z3o5qFlf2w)

Once you have setup OnShape, it is very straightforward to create documents, share them with team members, and much more additional functionality.

### Setting up the FTC Parts Library

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt1EAWGoH3U) is a video on how to import FTC parts into OnShape.

However, there is a much faster process that uses the FTC Parts Library. Basically, a library of documents with the CAD for FTC parts is already shared
with you in OnShape. All you have to do is import them into your document instead of downloading them from the supplier's website. 
[On gm0.org,](https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/useful-resources.html#part-libraries) there is a link to the [2901 Purple Gears Onshape Parts Library](https://ftconshape.com/introduction-to-the-ftc-parts-library/).

It is located on the second link line, and by clicking it, you can read a document on how to install it and use it.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us!

### Learning CAD in FTC

[Here](https://sites.google.com/marist.com/robotics3/unit-02?authuser=0) is a cirriculum by Mr. Michaud on learning CAD. This cirriculum has assignments that you can complete that test your knowledge in CAD.
You can get started on this cirriculum by visiting the link, reading the objectives, and clicking on the dropdown at the navigation bar (top of the screen) that says *"Unit 2"*.

If you would like to become extremely confident with CAD, I would complete all 16 lessons!
However, if you want to quickly get setup with creating CADs, here are a list of videos I would recommend watching, possibly in addition to the above cirriculum.
