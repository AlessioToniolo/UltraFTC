## Setting up VEX for Coding

Follow this guide to set up the VEX software for coding with blocks, but feel free to consult online resources, such as the [VRC Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vrc).  

1. Visit the [VEXcode installation website](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/install/v5).
2. Scroll down until you see `Download VEXcode V5 (Blocks and Text) - v2.3.1`.
3. Press on the `Download for Windows` button. You should see the downloading file in a popup at the bottom of your browser (if your using chrome)
4. Open the installer, you can do this by pressing on the popup at the bottom of the browser, or by double-clicking on the installer in your file explorer.
5. Follow the installer's instructions to download.
6. Once you have completed the installer's instructions, launch the `VEXcode v5` executable application.
7. Plug in the white cable (Micro-USB to USB-A) into the brain and computer, with the USB-A, the large plug, in the computer and the *Micro*-usb plugging into the port on the brain.
8. If you see the brain appear green in the topleft, you are good to go!

*What the software looks like!*

Play around with the blocks program. If you want to use the clawbot, navigate to 
- File
- Open Examples
- Templates
- 2 motor drivetrain clawbot (no gyro)
Then, you will have the template necessary to start creating files. When you create a "project," make sure you select an unused slot in the top-left.


**IMPORTANT: WHEN UPLOADING CODE, MAKE SURE TO PRESS DOWNLOAD TO UPLOAD THE CODE ONTO THE ROBOT.** Optionally, instead of running the program from the controller or the brain,
you can run this from the computer by pressing the `Run` button in the top-right.
